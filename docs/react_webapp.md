# React Webapp GUI

## Overview

We decided to switch from a tkinter GUI to a web-based React GUI for increased performance and editability
The backend incoporates a Fast API.

## Setup

To run the Fast API Backend,

```
cd base_station\web_app  
python app.py
```
The backend should start running at https://localhost:6543.

To run the React Frontend,
```
cd base_station\web_app\React\auv_gui
npm run start
```
The GUI should start running at http://localhost:3000.
